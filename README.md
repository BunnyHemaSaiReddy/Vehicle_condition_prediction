# Vehicle_condition_prediction
Vehicle maintenance is crucial for ensuring safety and longevity. By leveraging AI and machine learning, we can predict the overall condition of a car based on various internal system parameters. This project builds a predictive model that takes multiple input features related to a carâ€™s condition and determines an overall rating.
